# Domain Driven Design in dynamic languages
This is an attempt to collect all info about Domain Driven Design the World knows in dynamic languages (Python, Ruby, PHP etc). Not only DDD but all worthy info about layered and clean architecture with separation of business logic from infrastructure and framework code.

So let's go!
